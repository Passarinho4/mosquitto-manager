Mosquitto Manager is a simple addon to mosquitto which allows you to manage mosquitto pskfile via json over HTTP API.
All credentials are stored as Kubernetes Custom Resources, so if you do not need to worry about db, ldap or other
external distributed storage in your K8s cluster.

The code is in pre-alpha version please do not use it in production.

Command line options:
flag.String("kubeconfig", "", "absolute path to the kubeconfig file")
flag.Int("mosquittoPid", 1, "pid of mosquitto process")
flag.String("pskFilePath", "/etc/pskfile", "path to pskfile")
flag.String("basicAuthLogin", "", "basic auth login")
flag.String("basicAuthPass", "", "basic auth password")

if basic auth is not set endpoints are not secured.

More details will be added in the future.
